          <p>JWS is a UK company that builds and repairs windows for period properties, from Victorian period to Tudor and related styles in between. Their headquarters and factory are located in Crewe and have two other offices in the Midlands and in South West England. They are currently looking for expansion but their lack of IT support for managing their survey bookings is impeding them reaching their goal.</p>
          <p class="dark">As part of the assessment, they count the number of windows, measure them, and identify the architectural style (Elizabethan, Georgian, etc.). All this information is collected in a paper-based form. At the end of a survey, surveyors take pictures of the completed forms and send them via email to the headquarters using their mobile phones.</p>

          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <p>Currently, customers call JWS to request a quote for new windows or repairing existing ones. In order to provide an accurate quote, surveyors have to visit the property and assess the status of windows. When customers call, they provide their details (name, contact number, email address, and property address) and book a survey at an arranged date and time. Surveyors visit the property at the agreed time to assess the property windows.</p>
